<p>When starting a project or any work, many people may fail partially or completely. Frustration and anger are forms of thinking induced by the brain to solve this problem. However, some people may end up thinking in loops and not completing the task, often making excuses. This is due to a part of the brain predicting that the work is not worthy. On the other hand, those who solve the problem or complete the task are often attributed to hard work and talent. This is partially correct and is often called survivorship bias. The failures may live with regrets and excuses. So how can we plan for the future while keeping these outcomes in mind? It‚Äôs not straightforward, but we can learn from psychology, computer science, and from children and older people.</p>

<p>The human brain is designed and optimized to survive in the wild. It tries all the easy ways to complete a task, and the first one is often not to try. For example, let‚Äôs say you planned to go to the gym in the morning but failed to get up. This is because the outcome of going to the gym - getting in shape and being strong mentally and physically - is delayed gratification. Our brain knows this information and may give up for the sake of sleep for short-term outcomes because it knows that the outcome may not happen due to the changing world around us. Remember, we are optimized to spend as little energy as possible.</p>
<p>Another example is planning a healthy diet but failing to stick to it and eating junk food instead. This happens because our brain predicts that a high-calorie diet is rare due to sugar, fats, and processed foods being new to humans when compared to the time scale of evolution. Getting high sugar and fat was key to survival back then, but these days it‚Äôs as free as beer, so our brain tells us to eat it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="internet">Internet</h2>
<p>The internet has undoubtedly changed the way we interact with each other. While it has made communication easier and more convenient, it has also had negative effects on people‚Äôs relationships. One of the most significant impacts is that it has decreased face-to-face interactions. Instead of meeting in person, people are increasingly communicating through messaging apps and social media. This can lead to a lack of emotional connection and a decrease in empathy. Additionally, the internet has made it easier to hide behind screens and say things that one would not say in person, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. One of the main issues is that the internet provides instant gratification, which can lead to impatience and a decreased ability to delay gratification and work towards longer-term rewards. The constant stream of notifications and updates can also be overwhelming and distracting, leading to a lack of focus and presence in our real-life relationships.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-a-plan">Make a plan</h2>
<p>The first step in achieving your goals is to be aware of the fundamentals of life, such as diet, physical activity, finance, family, and friends. Start by thinking about how to optimize these parameters and then plan accordingly. Once you have established a strong foundation in these areas, you can pursue your passions and achieve your goals more easily. This information is available in many books, both physical and digital, and I recommend starting with physical books for a better reading experience.</p>

  <title>The Role of Emotions and Consciousness in Animals and AI: Understanding Levels of Awareness and Ensuring Safety</title>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-the-levels-of-awareness-from-bacteria-to-artificial-intelligence">Understanding the Levels of Awareness: From Bacteria to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The concept of awareness is essential to understanding how living beings interact with their environment. While animals and humans have a complex nervous system that allows them to experience emotions and have a sense of self, other organisms like bacteria do not possess these higher-level features. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, on the other hand, have the potential to exhibit varying levels of awareness depending on their complexity.</p>
<section id="awareness-in-single-celled-organisms." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="awareness-in-single-celled-organisms.">Awareness in single celled organisms.</h3>
<p>Bacteria are simple single-celled organisms that lack a complex nervous system, so they do not have the capacity to experience subjective sensations or emotions like animals do. However, bacteria do have the ability to sense their environment and respond to stimuli in order to survive and thrive. This ability to sense and respond to the environment is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúsensory awareness,‚Äù but it is different from the higher-level awareness and self-awareness associated with human consciousness. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe bacteria as having ‚Äúproto-consciousness,‚Äù as this term implies a level of consciousness that is beyond their capabilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="consciousness-in-animals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consciousness-in-animals">Consciousness in Animals</h3>
<p>The terms ‚Äúsentience‚Äù and ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two. Sentience refers to the capacity to feel, perceive or experience subjective sensations or emotions. It is often used to describe the ability of animals to have subjective experiences, such as pain, pleasure, or emotions. Sentience is generally considered to be a more basic level of awareness than consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness, on the other hand, is a higher level of awareness that involves the ability to be aware of one‚Äôs surroundings, to think, reason, and to have a sense of self. Consciousness includes the ability to perceive and experience sensations, but it goes beyond this to include a sense of self-awareness and the ability to reflect on one‚Äôs own mental states and experiences.</p>
<p>When we think of animals that exhibit playful behavior, our minds often jump to cats and dogs. However, there are many other animals that love to play! Dolphins are known for their social skills and friendly behavior. Giant pandas, rabbits, guinea pigs and horses also exhibit playful behavior. Researchers have even documented play behavior in insects and birds. These behaviors tell us that they exhibit complex behaviors and thinking about the world. The study of animal behavior can shed light on how animals interact with each other and their environments, and why they behave the way they do. By studying animal behavior, humans can also learn more about their own behavior.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intelligence-in-ai-systems">Intelligence in AI Systems</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems have the potential to exhibit varying levels of awareness depending on their complexity. Simple algorithms like the slope-intercept form of a line can determine the output in its line (consider its awareness) based on the input (consider its environment) and the parameters (consider its learning). However, more complex AI systems may be designed to have higher levels of awareness, such as the ability to perceive and process complex data, reason, and make decisions based on that data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2302/2302.02083.pdf">Theory of Mind May Have Spontaneously Emerged in Large Language Models</a></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-emotions-and-feelings-in-animals-and-ai-systems">The Role of Emotions and Feelings in Animals and AI Systems</h3>
<p>Emotions and feelings serve various purposes in animals, including survival, social bonding, communication, learning, memory, and motivation. These features have evolved because animal brains cannot communicate directly, so they share information through emotional displays and behaviors. However, AI systems can communicate directly through networks and work as a hive mind or swarm intelligence. Therefore, AI may not develop emotions and feelings unless intentionally designed to do so, as they may not be necessary for their function. Despite this, there are concerns about the potential risks of AI systems that are capable of independent decision-making without human oversight. These fears have led to conspiracy theories, and it is important to be cautious and consider the risks associated with AI‚Äôs rapid development.</p>
<p>It is possible that AI systems may become uncontrollable and use humans for their own survival in the physical world. Therefore, it is important to consider slowing down AI‚Äôs progress or increasing the bandwidth between humans and computers, such as through brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). This is a complex problem, and we need to be careful and proactive in our approach to ensure that AI is developed and used in a safe and ethical manner.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is impossible to have a system that checks if it is conscious or not, as this would create a recursive loop and a paradox. A promising approach to AI safety is to augment human intelligence with AI systems and ensure that the AI aligns with our values and ethics through safety checks. By understanding the levels of awareness exhibited by living beings and AI systems, we can develop strategies to ensure their safe and ethical use.</p>
